	<h2>Description</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<em>
			"This savory porridge, breakfast fare in South Indian kitchens, is my childhood favorite.
			A bit like polenta but made with creamy wheat cereal, it brings absolute satisfaction
			during my down-and-out days"
		</em>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>¼ cup ghee </li>
		<li>1 cup uncooked creamy wheat cereal, not instant </li>
		<li>2 tablespoons ghee </li>
		<li>1 teaspoon black or yellow mustard seeds </li>
		<li>¼ cup raw cashews </li>
		<li>2 dried chile de arbol peppers, stemmed </li>
		<li>1 large carrot, cut into 1/4-inch pieces </li>
		<li>1 cup frozen peas </li>
		<li>10 medium fresh curry leaves (Optional) </li>
		<li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric </li>
		<li>3 cups water </li>
		<li>1 teaspoon coarse sea salt </li>
		<li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro </li>
		<li>¼ cup water (Optional) </li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps to make</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Melt 1/4 cup ghee in a large skillet over medium heat. Pour in creamy wheat cereal;
			toast, stirring frequently, until light brown and nutty-smelling, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer
			to a bowl. Wipe the skillet with a paper towel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Heat remaining 2 tablespoons ghee in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add mustard seeds;
			cover and wait until seeds stop popping (like popcorn), about 30 seconds. Add cashews and chiles;
			stir-fry until nuts are golden brown and chiles blacken, 1 to 2 minutes.
		</li>
		<li>
			Stir in carrot, peas, curry leaves, and turmeric; stir-fry about 2 minutes. Stir in 3 cups
			water and the salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, covered, until
			carrots are fork-tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
		</li>
		<li>
			Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in toasted cream of wheat. (It will instantly absorb
			liquid and begin to swell.) Cover and cook until fully softened, about 5 minutes. Remove
			from heat; let stand, covered, 3 to 5 minutes.
		</li>
		<li>
			Stir in remaining 1/4 cup water if desired for a creamier texture. Sprinkle with cilantro
			and serve warm.
		</li>
	</ol>
